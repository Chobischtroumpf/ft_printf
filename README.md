# ft_printf
this is my code for the ft_printf project from the 42cursus @ school 19
the point of this project was to teach us how to properly structure our code, 
and how to use structures as well as to reimplement our own version of the 
printf function from the libc



ps : if for some reason someone tries this code and it doesnt work, check if the libft
is actually there and if it is and it doesnt work, please notify me, it means
I probably changed some of the libft functions
